# Odin Recipe Website
A basic website containing the recipes you need for your favorite foods.

## Reflection
In this project, I have demonstrated a solid understanding of HTML elements, which consist of opening and sometimes closing tags. I learned how to create lists (ordered and unordered), links, and images. I also learned how to set up my project structure, which will help me create more complex websites.
