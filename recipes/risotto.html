        <h3>Description</h3>

            should be soft and delicate.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Broth</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Shallots</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Wine</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat the broth: </strong>Bring the broth to a simmer, then reduce the heat to keep warm while you start the risotto.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté the onion and toast the rice: </strong>Cook the shallots (or onions) in butter just until softened but not browned 
                to begin building flavor in the risotto. Add the rice and cook until starting to turn translucent.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the wine: </strong>Pour in dry white wine, and stir to release any grains of rice stuck to the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the broth slowly: </strong>Stir the warm broth into the rice, 1/2 cup at a time. 
                Stirring helps to develop the risotto’s signature creamy consistency because it helps release the starches from the rice. 
                Wait until the rice is about halfway done before adding the seasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Know when the risotto is ready: </strong>The risotto is ready when the rice is the creamy consistency of thick porridge 
                but is still al dente and not too soft. Run your spatula through the risotto, and it should flow slowly to fill in the space.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir in butter and Parmesan: </strong>Remove the pot from the heat and let the residual heat to melt the butter and Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
