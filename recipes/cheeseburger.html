        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> A cheeseburger is one of the most common dishes in America, typically containing one or more slices of melted cheese 
            on top of a meaty patty along with several flavory ingredients.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Buns</li>
            <li>Honey mustard</li>
            <li>Ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
            <li>America cheese</li>
            <li>Special sauce (mayo)</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Sweet pickle</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat the bacon: </strong>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ÂºF. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange 8 bacon slices in a single layer on the foil. Bake until browned and crisp, 19 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the toppings: </strong>Meanwhile, prepare the toppings and cook the burger patties. Place 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon ketchup, and 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish in a small bowl and stir to combine.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread and slice: </strong>Remove the leaves from 1/2 medium head iceberg lettuce until you have 8 burger-sized leaves. Using a serrated knife, slice 1 beefsteak tomato crosswise into 4 slices. Split 4 hamburger buns and spread 2 tablespoons yellow mustard on the cut sides of the top buns, evenly spreading it to the edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the patty: </strong>Divide 1 pound ground chuck into 4 portions, then form each portion into a ball. Press each ball into a patty about 1/2-inch wider than the hamburger buns. Sprinkle the patties all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Place on pan: </strong>Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet (at least 12 inches wide) or griddle over medium-high heat until shimmering. (If using a smaller skillet, cook the buns and burgers in 2 batches.) Tilt the pan so the oil coats the bottom. Place the mustard buns in the pan mustard-side down, gently press down on them, and cook until toasty and browned in spots, 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Place the bottom buns cut-side down in the pan and cook until golden brown and toasted, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to the plate with the mustard buns. Reserve the pan.</li>
            <li><strong>When bacon is ready: </strong> When the bacon is ready, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and cut or tear in half crosswise. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom with oil. Add the burger patties (cook in 2 batches if needed) and press on each patty with the back of a flat spatula. Cook until the bottoms are deeply browned and the patty is halfway cooked, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip the burgers and place 1 slice of cheese on each patty. Cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes more, depending on desired burger doneness.</li>
            <li><strong>Finishing touches: </strong>Transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the mayonnaise mixture on the cut sides of the bottom buns, spreading to the edges. Assemble the burgers: Place a patty on each bottom bun. Top each patty with 4 bacon pieces, 1 tomato slice, 2 lettuce leaves, and the top bun.</li>
